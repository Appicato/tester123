# MetinPythonLib V0.3.1

Adds some functions to the python API, and try to inject a script.py from the current directory. 

## Things that need to be checked before moving across servers:

- Packet Headers and structures
- Patterns of send, recv, GetEther, SendAttackPacket, SendStatePacket and network class pointer
- Structure of CMappedFile
- The executed script is resposible for making sure the following functions work properly:
  - Module app
    - Function OpenTextFile
    - Function IsExistFile


## Python Exports
- Module net_packet
  - Get(\<string\> filePath) returns \<bytearray\><br>
    Similar to old app.Get, allows to extract any file encrypted.
    
  - IsPositionBlocked(\<int\>x,\<int\>y) returns \<boolean\><br>
    Allows to check if a map position is walkable(mobs don't count), true if is walkable or false if is not walkable.<br>
    Note: For better pathfinding, unblocked points that are close(1 unit) to a blocked point, are considered blocked too.<br>
    There is a bug with objects, since i can't figure out how to load the objects.
    
  - FindPath(\<int\>x_start,\<int\>y_start,\<int\>x_end,\<int\>y_end) returns \<tuple\>(x,y)<br>
    Finds a path between 2 points. <br>
    The path will not contain the current point.<br>
    It's possible to edit the maps, by changing the files in Resources/Maps, 0 represents a blocked location and the 1 represents a walkable position. The module will generate a new map if the same does not exist.<br>
    
  - SendPacket(\<int\>size,\<bytearray\>buffer) return None<br>
    Sends a packet to the server bypassing any encryption set.<br>
    
  - SendAttackPacket(\<int\>vid,\<byte\>type)<br>
    Sends an attack packet to the server, the type is usually 0.<br>
    
  - SendStatePacket(\<float\>x,\<float\>y,\<float\>rotation_angle,\<byte\>eFunc, \<byte\>uArgs)<br>
    Sends a packet containing the current state of the main player, can be used to change position,rotation and attack state on server side only.
    The value eFunc can take the fallowing values: CHAR_STATE_ATTACK,CHAR_STATE_STOP,CHAR_STATE_WALK<br>
    If eFunc == CHAR_STATE_ATTACK then the uArgs value can take one of the following values:
  - CHAR_STATE_ARG_HORSE_ATTACK1
	- CHAR_STATE_ARG_HORSE_ATTACK2
	- CHAR_STATE_ARG_HORSE_ATTACK3
	- CHAR_STATE_ARG_COMBO_ATTACK1
	- CHAR_STATE_ARG_COMBO_ATTACK2
	- CHAR_STATE_ARG_COMBO_ATTACK3
	- CHAR_STATE_ARG_COMBO_ATTACK4<br>
   otherwise the value can be NULL or CHAR_STATE_ARG_NONE<br>
   All this constants are defined in the module.<br>
       
  - \<dict\>InstancesList<br>
    -> Is a dictionary containing all vids currently in sight as keys and values<br>
    Note: Use the keys as vids, the values may be changed on a new version<br>

  - IsDead(\<int\>vid) returns 1 or 0<br>
    Returns 1 if the instance with the vid provided is dead or doesn't exist and returns 0 otherwise<br>

  - SendStartFishing(\<word\>direction)<br>
    Sends a packet to the server to start fishing, the direction parameter is a word only understandable by the server(will be converted in the future).
    
  - SendStopFishing(\<byte\>type,\<float\>timeLeft)<br>
    Sends a packet to the server to stop fishing, the type can be any of the following parameters:<br>
    - SUCCESS_FISHING -> The mini game was solve successfully.
    - UNSUCCESS_FISHING -> The mini game was not solve.<br>
    The timeLeft represents the time left to fish.<br>

  - SendAddFlyTarget(\<int\>vid,\<float\>x,\<float\>y)<br>
    Sends a packet to send an arrow at an enemy.<br>
 
  - SendShoot(\<byte\>uSkill)<br>
    Sends an attack packet to the current selected enemy (should be used after SendAddFlyTarget).<br>
    uSkill can be:<br>
    - COMBO_SKILL_ARCH -> Normal attack.
    
  - BlockFishingPackets()<br>
    Blocks client from sending fishing packets (this module will still be able to send)<br>
    
  - UnblockFishingPackets()<br>
    Unblocks client from sending fishing packets.<br>
    
  - DisableCollisions()<br>
    Disable client colisions with objects and the terrain (Wallhack).<br>
    
  - EnableCollisions()<br>
    Enable client colisions.<br>
    
  - RegisterNewShopCallback(\<callable_function\>callback)<br>

    That callback will be called with the shop vid as the first argument.<br>
	
  - RegisterDigMotionCallback(\<callable_function\>callback)<br>
    Sets a callback function, that will be called whenever a dig motion(mining packet) is called.<br>
	  The callback function will be called with the following arguments (player_vid,ore_vid,count)<br>
	
  - \<string\>PATH<br>
    Path of the location where the library was injected<br>

  - GetCloseItemGround(\<int\>x,\<int\>y) returns a tupple (\<int\>vid,\<int\>x,\<int\>y)<br>
    Returns the closest pickable item in the ground relative to the position given.<br>
    The items will be fitler acording to the pickup filter (see below).<br>
    Also, it will ignore items owned by other player.

  - SendPickupItem(\<int\>itemVID)<br>
    Sends a packet to pickup an item from the ground<br>

  - SetMoveSpeedMultiplier(\<float\> speed)<br>
    Set the character movement boosting movement speed. 

  - SendUseSkillPacket(\<int\> skillIndex, \<int\> vid)<br>
    Uses a skill by providing a skillIndex and a target vid without doing the animation.

  - SendUseSkillPacketBySlot(\<int\> skillSlotIndex, \<int\> vid)<br>
    The same as SendUseSkillPacket but the first argument is a slot index instead of the skill index<br>
    And also sets the cooldown of the skill on the client.<br>

  - IsPathBlocked(\<int\>x_start,\<int\>y_start,\<int\>x_end,\<int\>y_end)<br>
    Returns false if none of the points is blocked in a straight line other, if any of the points is blocked returns true.<br>

    Instruct the client to skip the drawing process, this can save CPU.<br>

  - UnskipRenderer()<br>
    Instruct the client to start drawing again.<br>

  - SyncPlayerPosition(\<list\>victims)<br>
    This is part of an exploit that allows to teleport other players.<br>
    The argument victims is a list of lists, each row containing vid victim, x coordinates and y coordinates.<br>
    As far as analyzed, for this to work, a special state packet need to be sent with the following arguments ```eXLib.SendStatePacket(mx,my,0,3,17)```
    where mx and my are the mob coordinates.<br>

  - SetRecvChatCallback(\<function\>callbackFunction)<br>
    Sets a callback function that will be called with the following arguments: ```int vid,int type,int empire,string msg,string locale```.<br>

    type is the type of message and can take the following values ``` CHAT_TYPE_TALKING,CHAT_TYPE_INFO,CHAT_TYPE_NOTICE,CHAT_TYPE_PARTY,CHAT_TYPE_GUILD,CHAT_TYPE_COMMAND,CHAT_TYPE_SHOUT,CHAT_TYPE_WHISPER``` that can be found on the chat module. 
    msg is the message content.
    empire is the empire of the player.
    locale is the region from the player that send the message or empty if was not a player.



### Remote Communication
Communication with the outside world.
All functions are asynchronous.

 - GetRequest(\<string\> url,\<callable_function\>callback) returns \<int\><br>
   Sends a async GET request to the specified url.
   The callback is called when the response arrives from the server, it will be called with 2 arguments, the ID of the request and a string message respectively.
   If the request is successful it returns an ID of the request otherwise returns -1.


 - OpenWebsocket(\<string\> url,\<callable_function\>callback) returns \<int\><br>
   Opens a websocket to the specified url.
   The callback is responsible for handling the receive messages. It will be called every time a message is received, with 2 arguments, the ID of the socket and a string containing the message respectively .
   If the request is schedule successfully it returns an ID of the socket otherwise returns -1.
   
 - SendWebsocket(\<int\> id,\<string\>message) returns \<int\><br>
   Sends a message to the socket with the specified id.
   If the message is schedule successfully it returns 1 otherwise returns 0.

 - CloseWebsocket(\<int\> id) returns \<int\><br>
   Closes a socket with the specified id.
   If the message is schedule successfully it returns 1 otherwise returns 0.

### Pickup Filter
A filter o be applied when calling GetCloseItemGround, by default the filter is set to pick items not present in filter.

  - ItemGrndDelFilter(\<int\> index)<br>
    Deletes an item id from the filter.

  - ItemGrndAddFilter(\<int\> index)<br>
    Adds an item id to the filter.

  - ItemGrndOnFilter()<br>
    Changes the filter mode, to only return items in the filter.

  - ItemGrndNotOnFilter()<br>
    Changes the filter mode, to ignore all items present in the filter.

  - ItemGrndFilterClear()<br>
    Deletes every item in the filter.

  - GetItemGrndID(\<int\> VID)<br>
    Return the ID of an item in the ground with the specified VID<br> 

  - ItemGrndSelectRange(\<float\> range)<br>
    Set's the maximum range to pick items<br> 

  - ItemGrndItemFirst()<br>
    Makes the function GetCloseItemGround return the closest item if there is no item returns the closest yang<br> 

  - ItemGrndNoItemFirst()<br>
    Makes the function GetCloseItemGround return the closest item or yang closest<br>

  - ItemGrndInBlockedPath()<br>
    Ignore items items that are in a blocked path<br> 

  - ItemGrndNotInBlockedPath()<br>
    Allow to return items that are in a blocked path<br> 

  - SetRecvAddGrndItemCallback(\<function\>callbackFunction)<br>
    Sets a callback function that will be called with the following arguments: ```int vid, int itemIndex, long x, long y, string owner```.<br>
    This function will be called whenever the server sends a new ground item.

  - SetRecvChangeOwnershipGrndItemCallback(\<function\>callbackFunction)<br>
    Sets a callback function that will be called with the following arguments: ```int vid, string owner```.<br>
    This function will be called whenever the server sends a change in a ground item ownership (every item that is dropped with an owner will also recive this packet after the append)
    If the owner argument is an empty string then the item doesn't have an owner.

  - SetRecvDelGrndItemCallback(\<function\>callbackFunction)<br>
    Sets a callback function that will be called with the following arguments: ```int vid```.<br>
    This function will be called whenever the server sends the command to delete a current item on the ground (this includes, the items being out of range and the item disappearement)
    WARNING: If you are trying are creating a list with items on the ground it might be needed to manually clear all items on phase change (Not tested)

### Simulation of old functions
These simulates the functions that were removed from the modules by Gameforge.

  - GetPixelPosition(\<int\>vid) returns a tupple (x,y,z)<br>
    Returns the position of the player by vid

  - MoveToDestPosition(\<float\> x,\<float\> y)<br>
    Moves to a destination.
	
  - SetMoveSpeed(\<float\> speed)<br>
    Set the character movement speed. The client might change the speed again need to be called constantly for now.
    If speed bigger then 2.0, the client will disconnect.

    Removes a packet coming from the server from the skipped packets.

  - DoNotSkipInHeader(\<int\>packet header)<br>
    Removes a packet going to the server from the skipped packets.

  - ClearOutput()<br>
    Clear what's in the console.
  
  - ClearInFilter()<br>
    Clear all headers from the filter coming from the server.

  - ClearOutFilter()<br>
    Clear all headers from the filter going to the server.

  - SetOutFilterMode(\<int\>mode)<br>
    Changes filter mode for outgoing packets, if set to 1, it will shows all packets that  correspond to the filter, if set to 0 it will show all packets that are not within the filter.

  - SetInFilterMode(\<int\>mode)<br>
    Changes filter mode for incoming packets, if set to 1, it will shows all packets that  correspond to the filter, if set to 0 it will show all packets that are not within the filter


## Compiling Notes

Python 2.7 (32 bits) needs to be installed in the system (C:/Python27) by default.

- Dependencies using vcpkg:
  cpprestsdk -> ```vcpkg install --recurse cpprestsdk[default-features,websockets]:x86-windows-static```
  curl -> ```vcpkg install curl[core,openssl]:x86-windows-static```
  jsoncpp -> ```vcpkg install jsoncpp:x86-windows-static```
  websocketpp -> ```vcpkg install websocketpp:x86-windows-static```
  boost -> ```vcpkg install boost:x86-windows-static```

Also the project is using [SimpleIni](https://github.com/brofield/simpleini) to parse the .ini configuration file and [Date](https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date) to format date.
